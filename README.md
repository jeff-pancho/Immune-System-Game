# Immune-System-Game
An educational game about the immune system I made for an 8th grade science assignment

This was coded in Lua using [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), a 2D game engine.

# How to run
Since this game was created using an older version of love (0.9.1), download LÖVE [here](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.9.1-win64.zip) and extract it somewhere. Then, clone this repo somewhere else.

The simplest way to run this game is to drag the folder of the repo that you cloned right into love.exe in the folder you extracted the .zip file.

Alternatively, you can launch the game from the command line:

```
"path-to-love-folder\love.exe" "path-to-game-folder"
```

For example:

```
"C:\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Immune-System-Game"
```

If you don't want to download LÖVE, then you can find the game under the [Releases](https://github.com/jeff-pancho/Immune-System-Game/releases) section. Just extract the .zip file and run the executable file to play the game.
